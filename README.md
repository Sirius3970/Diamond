# Diamond
An experimental programming language written in Python to serve as a proof-of-concept for distinguishing languages from interpreters.

To use this, open the test.py file. This will then read the contents of the "testfile.dim" file and run everything else from there. I have not yet found a way to get the .dim format recognized to automatically run by clicking for a specific Python script process.
